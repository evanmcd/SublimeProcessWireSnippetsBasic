Sublime ProcessWire Snippets - Basic
==================================

A collection of [ProcessWire](http://www.processwire.com) Snippets for Sublime Text 2.  These are based on the [ProcessWire2+ Cheatsheet version 1.1](http://cheatsheet.processwire.com).  This collection includes all the snippets in the cheatsheet when viewed without advanced mode on.  If you'd like to add the snippets with the advanced setting on, you'll want to grab the [Advanced Snippet Collection](https://github.com/evanmcd/SublimeProcessWireSnippetsAdvanced/)

## Installation
If you're using Git, the best method is to clone this repository to your ST Packages folder. (on Mac, it's here: /Users/your_username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/).

You can also [download the zip file](https://github.com/evanmcd/SublimeProcessWireSnippetsBasic/archive/master.zip) and unzip into the Packages folder.

Either way, I would recommend creating a ProcessWire subfolder as there are more than 100 files.

I'm looking into getting it into the excellent [Package Control](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control) which would let you install right from ST.

## Usage notes
The best way to trigger the snippets is to just start typing a ProcessWire object, like $pages.  You'll see a list of the matches, like $pages->find() and $pages->get().  If you know what you want, you could keep typing the specific method like this $pagesfind - selecting the snippet will present you with the proper PW syntax.

For now, entering a command like this $pages-> doesn't work. I'm still figuring out how to work with the > character in snippets.


## Coming updates
I'm looking into the best way to add important bits of documentation for the less well known commands.  For now, there isn't any documentation in the snippets.

Hope this speeds up your already speedy site development with ProcessWire.  :)
